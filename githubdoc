How to work with github.
Please note that this tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of the terms used in Git such as push, pull requests, commit, repository, etc. It also requires you to register to GitHub here and make a note of your GitHub username. So let's begin:
    1 Installing Git for Linux
sudo apt-get install git

    2 Configuring GitHub
git config --global user.name "akhilesh2"
git config --global user.email "akhilesh.kushawaha@gmail.com"
    3 Creating a local repository
Create a folder in your system. This will serve as a local repository which will later be pushed onto the GitHub website. Use the following command:
git init Mytest
git init /home/hduser/Mytest
cd Mytest
    4 Creating a README file to describe the repository
Now create a README file and enter some text like "this is a git setup on linux". The README file is generally used to describe what the repository contains or what the project is all about. Example:
gedit README
    5 Adding repository files to an index
Here we add all the things that need to be pushed onto the website into an index. These things might be the text files or programs that you might add for the first time into the repository or it could be adding a file that already exists but with some changes (a newer version/updated version).
Note that the "git add" command can be used to add any number of files and folders to the index. Here, when I say index, what I am refering to is a buffer like space that stores the files/folders that have to be added into the Git repository.
    6 Committing changes made to the index
Once all the files are added, we can commit it. This means that we have finalized what additions and/or changes have to be made and they are now ready to be uploaded onto our repository. Use the command :
    7 Creating a repository on GitHub
Creating a repository on GitHub
Create a repository on GitHub. Notice that the name of the repository should be the same as the repository's on the local system. In this case, it will be "Mytest". To do this login to your account on https://github.com. Then click on the "plus(+)" symbol at the top right corner of the page and select "create new repository". Fill the details as shown in the image below and click on "create repository" button.
Once this is created, we can push the contents of the local repository onto the GitHub repository in your profile. Connect to the repository on GitHub using the command:
git remote add origin https://github.com/user_name/Mytest.git
    8 Pushing files in local repository to GitHub repository
The final step is to push the local repository contents into the remote host repository (GitHub), by using the command:
git push origin master
